# SYNAPSE

Synapse is the software for a work in progress project by Rian O Donnell.
Currently only the classification program is public. A GAN is being 
developed to recreate the images.

## Project
The data is gathered by a subject looking at pictures of the numbers
0 - 9 and is gathered on an EPOC eeg headset with 14 channels. 
This program was able to gain an acucracy of 99.9% on the train dataset.
Email rodonnell.student21@stmarys.ie for the checkpoint.
